Getting Started
This doc will get you up and running with a simple Appium test and introduce you to some basic Appium ideas. For a more comprehensive introduction to Appium concepts, please check out the conceptual introduction.

Installing Appium
Appium can be installed in one of two ways: via NPM or by downloading Appium Desktop, which is a graphical, desktop-based way to launch the Appium server.

Installation via NPM
If you want to run Appium via an npm install, hack with Appium, or contribute to Appium, you will need Node.js and NPM (use nvm, n, or brew install node to install Node.js. Make sure you have not installed Node or Appium with sudo, otherwise you'll run into problems). We recommend the latest stable version, though Appium supports Node 8+.

The actual installation is as simple as:

npm install -g appium
